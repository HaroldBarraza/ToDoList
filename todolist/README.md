# Overview

{As a software developer, I want to practice and learn more about full-stack applications that interact with cloud services and manage data efficiently}

{This project is a Notes or Task List application, developed with Next.js, that allows users to create, categorize, complete, and delete personal notes.}

{The application connects to a PostgreSQL database in the cloud using Neon, where the notes and their categories are stored, and is hosted on Vercel. Users can add new notes with a title and text, and can also select a category. Notes are displayed grouped by category and can be easily marked as completed or deleted.}

{The main objective in developing this software was to practice and deepen my knowledge and skills in server-side rendering, form handling, and learning more about data using SQL in the cloud.}
